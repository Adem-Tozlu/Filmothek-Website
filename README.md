# Project – Filmothek

This project is a movie library that allows you to watch movie trailers. It was developed using React and Tailwind CSS. Since it does not use an API, it is primarily intended as a practice project. The project utilizes various hooks such as useState, useContext, and useEffect. It also features a dark mode.
